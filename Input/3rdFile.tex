\item \textbf{First document. This is a simple example, with no 
\item extra parameters or packages included.
\item Because this is my first Latex file ever. And since i love to work with computers i have to learn about latex to. Under here are some Random text from internet. Projects exported (downloaded) from Overleaf are provided as a .zip file which contains the source files used to create the typeset PDF. That .zip file will contain the source files only, it does not include the final typeset PDF itself which must be downloaded separately, after successful compilation.}
